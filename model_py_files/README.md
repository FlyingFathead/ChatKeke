These are the Python module files required for handling the TensorFlow GPT-2 model that's used for ChatKeke.

They're forked off of these repos:

https://github.com/openai/gpt-2/ and https://github.com/nshepperd/gpt-2/

All credits belong to their respective creators (aside from some small tweaks that I've made), these are here only for reference/mirror purposes and to make the deployement of the chatbot framework quicker.
